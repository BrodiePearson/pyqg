# pyqg - A Python Quasigeostrophic Model #

This is a pure-python implementation of the classic doubly-periodic pseudo-spectral quasigeostrophic model. So far it only supports two layers and a flat bottom.

## Installation ##

This is a legitimate python package. To use it, you should install it on your system by running

	python setup.py install
If you are helping to develop the code, you might prefer to install it in [development mode](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19048732/python-setup-py-develop-vs-install):

	python setup.py develop

## Usage ##

We have an [example ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rabernat/pyqg/blob/master/examples/pyqg_example.ipynb)
